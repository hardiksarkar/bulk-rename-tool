# Bulk Rename Tool

The "Bulk Rename Tool" is a Node.js script that allows you to rename multiple files and folders in a directory simultaneously. You can specify a word to be replaced and the word to replace it with, and the script will rename all files and folders that contain the specified word.

## Installation

To use the "Bulk Rename Tool," you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have Node.js, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

Once you have Node.js installed, you can follow the steps below to run the script:

1. Clone the repository or download the `index.js` file from the "bulk-rename-tool" GitHub repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the `index.js` file is located using the `cd` command.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: "npm install"


## Usage

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
- Launch your preferred terminal or command prompt application.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
- Change the directory to the location where you have the "bulk-rename-tool" files using the `cd` command.

3. **Run the Script:**
- Execute the "bulk-rename-tool" script by running the following command: "node index.js"

4. **Follow the Instructions:**
- The script will prompt you to enter two words:
  - The word you want to replace.
  - The word you want to replace it with.

5. **Review Proposed Changes:**
- The script will display a list of files and folders that will be renamed based on your input. Confirm the renaming action by entering "yes" or cancel it by entering "no."

6. **File Renaming:**
- If you confirm the renaming action, the script will rename the files and folders accordingly.

## Important Notes

- Please exercise caution when using the "Bulk Rename Tool." Renaming files and folders is irreversible, and there is no undo functionality. Always make sure to review the proposed changes before confirming.

- Ensure that you have a backup of your files before using the script. This way, you can revert to the original names if necessary.

- The script only renames files and folders in the current directory where the script is executed. It does not perform recursive renaming in subdirectories.
